# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for optimizing the loading speed and page transition performance of the LeLeTV video platform. The goal is to enhance user experience by reducing wait times during page navigation and video playback initiation.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This performance optimization aligns with the product vision of providing a seamless and efficient video viewing experience. Faster page transitions and loading times directly contribute to user satisfaction and engagement, which are core metrics for the platform's success.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want pages to load quickly, so that I can navigate between search results and video playback without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a video link THEN the system SHALL transition to the watch page within 1 second
2. WHEN a user navigates from the watch page to the player page THEN the system SHALL load the player interface within 2 seconds
3. WHEN a user returns to the search page from the player THEN the system SHALL restore the previous state within 500ms

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want videos to start playing quickly, so that I don't experience long buffering times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates video playback THEN the system SHALL begin playing the video within 3 seconds
2. IF the video source is slow THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator and estimated loading time
3. WHEN a user switches video sources THEN the system SHALL complete the transition within 2 seconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to feel responsive during navigation, so that I have a smooth browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls through search results THEN the system SHALL maintain a minimum 60fps frame rate
2. WHEN a user interacts with UI controls THEN the system SHALL respond within 100ms
3. WHEN a user performs multiple actions in quick succession THEN the system SHALL queue and process them without freezing

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each optimization module should have a single, well-defined purpose
- **Modular Design**: Performance optimization components should be isolated and reusable
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize interdependencies between optimization modules
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between components and optimization layers

### Performance
- Page transitions should complete within 1 second for 95% of cases
- Initial page load time should be under 2 seconds on 3G connections
- Video playback initiation should begin within 3 seconds for 90% of cases
- Memory usage should not exceed 100MB during normal operation

### Security
- All performance optimizations should maintain existing security measures
- Caching mechanisms should not expose sensitive user data
- Preloading should respect user privacy settings

### Reliability
- Optimizations should gracefully degrade if features are not supported
- Error handling should be maintained during performance enhancements
- Fallback mechanisms should be in place for critical optimization features

### Usability
- Performance improvements should not change the user interface
- Loading indicators should provide accurate progress information
- Users should be able to cancel long-running operations
