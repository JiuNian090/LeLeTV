# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the "联系乐乐" (Contact LeLe) functionality in the LeLeTV application. The goal is to improve user experience by providing a more seamless way for users to contact the administrator via email, with fallback mechanisms to ensure the email address is still accessible even if external email clients cannot be launched.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature supports the product's commitment to user-friendly communication channels, allowing users to easily reach out for support, feedback, or inquiries related to the LeLeTV service.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of LeLeTV, I want to be able to contact the administrator by email with a single click, so that I can quickly get support or share feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on the "联系乐乐" (Contact LeLe) link, THEN the system SHALL copy the email address "jiunian929@gmail.com" to the clipboard
2. WHEN the system has copied the email address, THEN the system SHALL attempt to open the default email client or provide a choice of email clients
3. WHEN the system attempts to open an email client, THEN the system SHALL prepopulate the "To" field with "jiunian929@gmail.com"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of LeLeTV, I want to see the copied email address if the email client cannot be opened, so that I can manually use the email address.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF the system cannot open an email client after copying the email address, THEN the text of the "联系乐乐" (Contact LeLe) link SHALL be replaced with "jiunian929@gmail.com" and highlighted
2. WHEN the email address is displayed, THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip or notification stating "'jiunian929@gmail.com' 已复制" (has been copied)
3. AFTER 3 seconds of displaying the email address, THEN the system SHALL revert the text back to "联系乐乐" (Contact LeLe)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each file should have a single, well-defined purpose
- **Modular Design**: Components, utilities, and services should be isolated and reusable
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize interdependencies between modules
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between components and layers

### Performance
- The email copying and client opening functionality should respond within 100ms of the user click
- The fallback display functionality should transition smoothly without visible delays

### Reliability
- The system should handle all edge cases gracefully, including browsers that don't support certain clipboard or email client opening features
- The feature should work consistently across different browsers and operating systems

### Usability
- The visual feedback should be clear and intuitive to users
- The email address should be easily readable when displayed as a fallback
